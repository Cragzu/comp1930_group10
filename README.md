**COMP 1930 - StudySource**  
*by Chloe Glave, Alireza Kakan, and Brian Duong*
    
StudySource is a prototype website allowing students to buy and sell used
textbooks. Once finished with a class, students often don't need their
textbooks anymore, so they can sell them to future students of that class.
The buyers will be able to get the books they need at a discounted price,
and the sellers make some of their money back as well as reduce clutter in
their living space.
