**COMP 1930 - StudySource**  
- 
*by Chloe Glave, Alireza Kakan, and Brian Duong*
    
StudySource is a prototype website allowing students to buy and sell used
textbooks. Once finished with a class, students often don't need their
textbooks anymore, so they can sell them to future students of that class.
The buyers will be able to get the books they need at a discounted price,
and the sellers make some of their money back as well as reduce clutter in
their living space.

**File Structure**
- 
- The `index.html` file is the main landing page, linking to other areas of the site.
- All `html` files are different pages in our website, named according to what they are.
- We have several `css` files in the `styles` folder, a main `stylesheet.css` containing most of our styles, and a few specialized ones
containing specific styles for certain things.
- Our `js` files contain scripts and components. They are located in the `scripts` folder. The `display...` JavaScript files are for
displaying various components in order to make them reusable, such as the page header. Other JavaScript files
contain functions for various features of our site. We also have a `firebase_setup.js` file containing our Firebase keys which are
used throughout the project.
